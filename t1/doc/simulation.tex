\subsection{Ngspice Analysis}

Table~\ref{tab:op} shows the simulated operating point results for the circuit
under analysis. Once again, current flows are the ones referred in ~\ref{sec:analysis}. \par
 A new voltage source $V_{aux}$ with voltage 0V (so it doesn't affect the circuit) was added to the circuit between components $R_6$ and $R_7$ so that Ngspice could simulate and calculate the current value in that branch. As expected, this current's value is the same as the one that flows through $R_6$ and $R_7$. Adding a new voltage source led to the creation of node 8 between $R_6$ and $V_{aux}$. Also, has predicted, voltage $V_8$ is the same as voltage $V_6$ since the voltage in $V_{aux}$ is 0V.
