\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

All in all, the analysis of the given circuit using the stated methods was achieved successfully. Nodal and mesh methods were performed both
theoretically using the Octave maths tool and by circuit simulation using the
NgSpice software. By analysing both outputs, we can see how precisely the simulation results matched the theoretical calculations. 
Given the fact that the circuit only has linear components, it makes sense that no discrepancies were detected. However, 
if we had been given a circuit with more complex components, the theoretical and simulation models could not match as precisely 
as they did in this laboratory assignment.
