\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:introduction}

The objective of this laboratory assignment is to study a circuit containing an
independent voltage source $V_A$, an independent current source $I_D$, seven resistors, 
a linearly dependent current source $I_B$ and a linearly dependent voltage source $V_C$.
The circuit can be seen if Figure~\ref{fig:t1}. The study of the circuit is done using 
both the mesh and the nodal analysis methods.


In Section~\ref{sec:analysis}, a theoretical analysis of the circuit using Octave is
presented. In Section~\ref{sec:simulation}, the circuit is analysed by
simulation with NGSpice software and the results are compared to the theoretical results obtained in
Section~\ref{sec:analysis}. Conclusions of this study can be found in
Section~\ref{sec:conclusion}.
