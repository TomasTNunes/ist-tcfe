\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:introduction}

In this laboratory assignment, we are asked to create an Audio Amplififer Circuit, in which we are supposed to design the architecture of the Gain and Output stages of the circuit. The goal is to achieve the best ratio between the cost of the circuit and its quality in terms of the specifications asked (Merit Figure): the gain's frequency response and the input and output impedances. \par
To build the circuit, we used 7 resistors, 3 capacitors and 2 transistors (one PNP type and one NPN type). A representative image of the circuit can be seen in \ref{fig:t4}. \par
As stated, the circuit has 2 different stages (gain and output), where the first one amplifies the input signal and the last one increases the output current. The gain stage is characterized by a high gain but the output impedance is also high, whereas the output stage has a near 1 gain with a low output impedance.


In Section \ref{sec:analysis}, a theoretical analysis of the circuit using Octave is
presented. In Section \ref{sec:simulation}, the circuit is analysed by
simulation with Ngspice software and the results are compared to the theoretical results in Section \ref{sec:sbs}. Conclusions of this study can be found in
Section \ref{sec:conclusion}.

The components used have the following values:
