\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:introduction}

The objective of this laboratory assignment is to study a circuit containing an
independent voltage source $V_a$, an independent current source $I_d$, seven resistors $R_1$ to $R_7$, a linearly dependent current source $I_b$ and a linearly dependent voltage source $V_c$.
The circuit can be seen in Figure~\ref{fig:t1}. The study of the circuit is done using 
both mesh and nodal analysis methods.


In Section~\ref{sec:analysis}, a theoretical analysis of the circuit using Octave is
presented. In Section~\ref{sec:simulation}, the circuit is analysed by
simulation with Ngspice software and the results are compared to the theoretical results obtained in
Section~\ref{sec:analysis}. Conclusions of this study can be found in
Section~\ref{sec:conclusion}.
