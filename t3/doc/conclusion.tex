\section{Conclusion}

All in all, this lab assignment showed us the challenges of a real project, because we were introduced to the concept of keeping a budget in mind while working on a solution to a problem. Once again, the outputs given by the predictions and the simulations differed considerably, and that can be seen as a consequence of the non-linear behavior of some of the components used (diodes). Also, the theoretical model used was the ideal one, which has some approximations in spite of giving consistent results.
