\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:introduction}

The objective of this laboratory assignment is to design an AC/DC converter circuit using an Envelope Detector circuit, a Voltage Regulator circuit and components such as resistors, capacitors and diodes. A representation of the circuit can be seen in Figure \ref{fig:t3}. 
The main goal of this project is to balance the cost of the circuit and its effectiveness given the characteristics required ($V_{out}=12V$ with DC signal). This is given by the Merit Figure. \par
Since we know the value of $V_1$ and we are considering the ideal model for a transformer, we can replace the transformer used by a dependent current source (on the left) and a dependent voltage source (on the right), as seen in Figure \ref{fig:t3}. Thus, the equations for these dependent sources are, respectively:

\begin{equation}
  i_1=\frac{1}{n}i_2
  \label{eq:kvl1}
\end{equation} 

\begin{equation}
  v_2=\frac{1}{n}v_1
  \label{eq:kvl2}
\end{equation} 

By trial and error, we concluded that the best design for the circuit in order to have the best quality/cost ratio was:
\quad using a Full-Wave Rectifier, a capacitor and a resistor for the Envelope Detector;
\quad using a resistor, 1x diodes for the Voltage Regulator.

In Section \ref{sec:analysis}, a theoretical analysis of the circuit using Octave is
presented. In Section \ref{sec:simulation}, the circuit is analysed by
simulation with Ngspice software and the results are compared to the theoretical results in Section \ref{sec:comparison}. Conclusions of this study can be found in
Section \ref{sec:conclusion}.
